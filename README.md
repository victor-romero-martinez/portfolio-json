## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layout.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...icon.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ libs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getYearsFn.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ type.d.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ componensts/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...component.astro 
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
